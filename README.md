# deepwoken-randomizer

As the title suggests, this is a Python program that randomly allocates a maximum of 323 investment points. It will also randomly choose a weapon class as well as an attunement (or no attunement). Super poorly written but... it works! This challenge is meant to be played with The Destined modifier, though I'm not your mom so I don't care. 

Things I'd like to add in the future if I don't forget:
- Points specifically allocated depending on race initial attributes: i.e., Adret starts with 2 Will and 2 Charisma so it will include that.
- Dual attunement options or no weapons options (heroblade)
- Oaths can easily be done just lazy right now

I don't care if you use this and don't credit me or anything but it'd be nice if you did.
